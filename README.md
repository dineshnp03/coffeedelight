Project 1  - Part 1 Submission :

You are not required to submit anything to this Assignments folder, it is here to allow your instructor to mark your in-person check in.

Each group member must attend a meeting and discuss the progress of the application. It is expected that each member will have contributed and marks will be deducted if a student is found to not have worked on the project so far.

At this point you should have: Firebase set up correctly; All necessary activities for your project; A proper database structure; Basic XML layouts (design is unimportant)

You should be prepared to show your professor this progress by the check in, and each group member should discuss exactly what they did for the project so far.
